# Melting Plot
Melting Plot is a choose-your-own-story-esque, collaborative platform for writers to come together and volunteer their creative spirit, one step at a time (quite literally!) These writers will work together to craft their own stories in a Melting Pot of storytelling ingenuity. We aim to encourage collaboration in creating worlds of fiction, diversifying individual stories, or even raising awareness! We feature a one-of-a-kind setting with a simple, easy-to-use user interface aimed to make the process of collaborative writing as smooth as possible!
